## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

- for learning purpose

# chapter - 1 (basic of projects)

## Folder structure

folder structure:

```md

- /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.ts at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

```

## Placeholder data

When you're building user interfaces, it helps to have some placeholder data. If a database or API is not yet available, you can:

Use placeholder data in JSON format or as JavaScript objects.
Use a 3rd party service like mockAPI.

# TypeScript

You may also notice most files have a .ts or .tsx suffix. This is because the project is written in TypeScript. We wanted to create a course that reflects the modern web landscape.

It's okay if you don't know TypeScript - we'll provide the TypeScript code snippets when required.

# chapter - 2 (tailwind & css)

1. How to add a global CSS file to your application.

2. Two different ways of styling: Tailwind and CSS modules.

3. How to conditionally add class names with the clsx utility package.

notes :-

i) always import global css on root layout ex: /app/layout.tsx

applying tailwing

<code>
<div
  className="relative w-0 h-0 border-l-[15px] border-r-[15px] border-b-[26px] border-l-transparent border-r-transparent border-b-black"
/>
<code>


CSS Modules
CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names, so you don't have to worry about style collisions as well.

We'll continue using Tailwind in this course, but let's take a moment to see how you can achieve the same results from the quiz above using CSS modules.

Inside /app/ui, create a new file called home.module.css and add the following CSS rules:

```css

/app/ui/home.module.css
.shape {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  border-bottom: 30px solid black;
  border-left: 20px solid transparent;
  border-right: 20px solid transparent;
}

```

```tsx

/app/page.tsx
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import styles from '@/app/ui/home.module.css';
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-6">
      <div className={styles.shape} />
    // ...
  )
}

```
